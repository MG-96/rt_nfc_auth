# RT NFC Auth
RT NFC Auth is part of the controll and authentication environment for machines in the hardware laboratory of the Westf√§lische Hochschule Campus Bocholt. 

This Repository contains the firmware for the RT NFC Authenticator based on the **ESP 8266** and the **Grove - NFC** module. The firmware is written in Arduino.

The RT NFC Authenticator acts as an dump NFC reader transmitting json encoded IDs over mqtt. Additional to the NFC reader the board contains 3 LEDs, 3 buttons and 1 buzzer that can be controlled with mqtt messges.

JSON strings transmitted from the authenticator look like this

**TAG ID Message**
```json
{
    id : 'some nfc tag id'
}
```

**Buttons Pressed Message**
```json
{
    button : 'button1',
    state : 'pressed'
}
```

**Buttons released Message**
```json
{
    button : 'button2',
    state : 'released'
}
```

JSON strings to control the LEDs and buzzer look like this

**LED Buzzer control message**
```json
{
    led1 : 'on',
    led2 : 'off',
    led3 : 'on',
    buzzer : 'on'
}
```
